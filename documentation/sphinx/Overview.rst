Overview
========

**Expyriment** is an open-source and platform independent light-weight Python 
library for designing and conducting timing-critical behavioural and 
neuroimaging experiments. The major goal is to provide a well-structured Python 
library for a script-based experiment development with a high priority on the 
readability of the resulting programme code. It has been tested extensively 
under Linux and Windows. 

**Expyriment** is an all-in-one solution, as it handles the stimulus 
presentation, recording of I/O events, communication with other devices and the 
collection and preprocessing of data. It offers furthermore a hierarchical 
design structure, which allows an intuitive transition from the experimental 
design to a running programme. It is therefore also suited for students as well 
as experimental psychologists and neuroscientists with little programming 
experience.

Main features
-------------
* Easy syntax, very readable (due to Python)
* Cross-platform (Linux, Windows, OS X)
* Allows for fast and efficient programming of experiments (do more with less 
  code)
* A variety of standard stimuli (Text, Picture, Audio, Video etc.)
* Keyboard, Mouse, Serial Port, Parallel Port and Gamepad support
* Hierarchical structure of experimental units (Experiment, Blocks, Trials, Stimuli)

For a full documentation of all Expyriment functionality (i.e. all available 
modules, classes, methods, functions, constants, and attributes provided by the 
Expyriment Python package), please have a look at the :doc:`API reference pages 
<expyriment>`


Example code
------------
Examples of full experiments can be found :doc:`here <Examples>`.

Creating experiments, blocks, trials and stimuli::

    exp = expyriment.design.Experiment()
    block = expyriment.design.Block()
    trial = expyriment.design.Trial()
    stimulus = expyriment.stimuli.TextLine(text="Hello World")

Building a hierarchy between various structures::

    trial.add_stimulus(stimulus)
    block.add_trial(trial)
    exp.add_block(block)

Presenting stimuli::

    for block in exp.blocks:
        for trial in block.trials:
            trial.stimuli[0].present()

Handling input devices::

    button, rt = exp.keyboard.wait([expyriment.misc.constants.K_SPACE])

Logging data::

    exp.data.add([button, rt])
