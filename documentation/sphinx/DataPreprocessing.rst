Data preprocessing
==================
In most cases, data acquired by Expyriment needs to be further processed before 
a statistical analysis can be performed. This processing entails an aggregation 
of the dependent variables over all factor-level combinations of the 
experimental design. Expyriment provides an easy, but flexible way to 
automatize this process with the included data preprocessing module of the misc 
package (:doc:`expyriment.misc.data_preprocessing`).
