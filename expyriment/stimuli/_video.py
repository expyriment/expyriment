class Video(_visual.Stimulus):
    """A class implementing a general video stimulus.

    This class uses a background thread for playing the video!
    
    Only MPEG-1 movies with MP3 audio are supported. You can use ffmpeg
    (www.ffmpeg.org) to convert from other formats:
        
        ffmpeg -i <inputfile> -vcodec mpeg1video -acodec libmp3lame -intra -qscale 2  <outputfile.mpg>
        
    The -qscale option is the quality setting. It can take values from 1 to 31.
    1 is the best quality, but big file size. 31 is the worst quality, but
    small file size. Play around with this setting to get a good balance
    between quality and file size.
    
    When the audio from the video should be played as well, the audiosystem
    has to be stopped (by calling expyriment.control.stop_audiosystem() )
    BEFORE the video stimulus is preloaded! After the stimulus has been played
    the audiosystem can be started again (by calling
    expyriment.control.start_audiosystem() ).

    When showing videos in large dimensions, and your computer is not fast
    enough, frames might be dropped! When using Video.wait_frame() or
    Video.wait_end(), dropped video frames will be reported and logged.
