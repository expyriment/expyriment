"""Python library for cognitive and neuroscientific experiments.

Expyriment is an open-source and platform independent light-weight Python
library for designing and conducting timing-critical behavioural and
neuroimaging experiments. The major goal is to provide a well-structured
Python library for a script-based experiment development with a high priority
on the readability of the resulting programme code. Due to the availability of
an Android runtime environment, Expyriment is also suitable for the
development of experiments running on tablet PCs or smart-phones.

Expyriment has been tested extensively under Linux and Windows and is an
all-in-one solution, as it handles stimulus presentation, the recording of
input/output events, communication with other devices, and the collection
and preprocessing of data. Furthermore, it offers a hierarchical design
structure, which allows for an intuitive transition from the experimental
design to a running program. It is therefore also suited for students, as well
as for experimental psychologists and neuroscientists with little programming
experience.
