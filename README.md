Overview
========
**Expyriment** is an open-source and platform-independent lightweight Python
library for designing and conducting timing-critical behavioral and
neuroimaging experiments. The major goal is to provide a well-structured
Python library for script-based experiment development, with a high priority
being the readability of the resulting program code.

**Expyriment** has been tested extensively under Linux and Windows and is an
all-in-one solution, as it handles stimulus presentation, the recording of
input/output events, communication with other devices, and the collection and
preprocessing of data. Furthermore, it offers a hierarchical design structure,
which allows for an intuitive transition from the experimental design to a
running program. It is therefore also suited for students, as well as for
experimental psychologists and neuroscientists with little programming
experience.
